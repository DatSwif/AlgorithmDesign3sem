#   300 vertices, can travel from each to each
#   1 iteration is when we get all ants through all vertices and then recount the pheromone
#   45 ants, among them 15 elite ants with double pheromone (elite ants?)
#   exploitation power 3, exploration power 2
#   evaporation 0,6
#   Lmin calculated with greedy algorithm (optimal path length?)
#   target variable is path length
